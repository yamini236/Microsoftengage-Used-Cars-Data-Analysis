<a name="why"></a>
## Why is this analysis reuired?
- **User View** - To know the price and features of used cars according to your favourable features and helps you decide to  buy a new or a used car.
- **Owner View** - By observing stats gain information about current aspects in automotive industry market and heps to increase production rates and selling units through it.
 

<a name="tech"></a>
## Technologies and Frameworks Used
- Built with Jupyter Notebook, Python, and PowerBi.
- Create predictive models using Machine Learning.

<a name="how"></a>
## How is Preprocessing Done
- **Missing Vlues** - Filled the missing values to generate efficient data.
- **Duplicate Values** - Removed Duplicate Values for better prediction and accuracy.


<a name="ss"></a>
## Analysis of data
- Analysis is done with respect to various features given in train dataset available in M.Engage.ipynb
- Some of the following are.

#### Variation of fuels

****
#### Variation of Transmission with price

## Prediction of Models
- Prediction of Price of Used Cars is done using Machine Learning Models.
- Accuracey of different models is compared.
- Best model is chosen to give accurate result.
- Initially already provided data from train dataset is used and tested using test dataset.
- Finally predictions are made using user inputs.

<a name="result"></a>
## Result
- Result of the model predictions.

<a name="decide"></a>
## Interpretation and Decision
- Used Cars are much preferable under low budget especially for college/university students.
- Diesel driven and Manual mode cars are favoured over others.
- Volvo series being expensive originally, has a much cheaper cost in case of used cars hence those you love this series can go for it.
- Selling unita and production can be increased efficiently using data analysis.
- Customers can predict price according to their favourable features.
